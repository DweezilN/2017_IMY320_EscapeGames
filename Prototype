Changes

The following changes were made from our proposal to our protoype:
- We decided to change the backgrounds from solid colour to images related to our game, since it creates more of a Game feel.		
- The navbar layout changed from being "Platforms" to a regular navigation bar.
- We changed our approach from mobile first to desktop, since our users will be playing the game from a desktop.
