Changes

The following changes were made from our proposal to our protoype:
				We decided to change the backgrounds from solid colour to images related to our game, so that the users can clearly see that it is         a website made for a game.
				
        The navbar layout changed from being "Platforms" to a regular navigation bar.
				
				We changed our approach from mobile first to desktop, since our users will be playing the game from a desktop.
